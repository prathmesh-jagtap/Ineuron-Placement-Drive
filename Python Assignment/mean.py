"""Write a function called ‘calculate_mean’ that takes a list of 
numbers as input and returns the mean (average) of the numbers. 
The function should calculate the mean using the sum of the numbers 
divided by the total count.

Example:

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    mean = total / count
    return mean

data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
mean_value = calculate_mean(data)
print("Mean:", mean_value)

Output:
Mean: 20.0
"""


def calculate_mean(numbers):
    sum = 0
    count = 0
    for i in numbers:
        sum += i
        count += 1
    return sum/count


data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
mean_value = calculate_mean(data)
print("Mean:", mean_value)
